All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added SD-backed offline Albums for storage-capable displays: manifests and
  verified frame blobs sync incrementally, up to 32 photos play sequentially or
  in a shuffle bag with the requested repeat policy, and local photo wakes keep
  Wi-Fi off between independent server heartbeats. One-off Image or Dashboard
  frames interrupt the Album until its next scheduled playback deadline without
  repeatedly postponing that deadline; reassignment or unbinding stops it on
  the next successful heartbeat.

### Fixed

- Stabilized reTerminal E1004 microSD reads after deep-sleep wake so cached
  Deck and Album frames remain usable instead of being treated as corrupt.
- Allowed the same rendered photo to occupy multiple Album positions without
  rejecting the complete collection manifest.
- Kept transient short SD reads from being mistaken for corrupt cached Deck or
  Album frames, and prevented repeated network frames from starving Album
  playback indefinitely.
